## Frontend Contributions

If you are interested in contributing only to the frontend, you can work on it by having a minimum requirement of a MetaMask wallet. While you won't be able to interact fully with the project's functionality without adding Sepolia Ethers, you'll still be able to work on the UI components. 

## Blockchain Contributions

For blockchain contributions, you'll need to familiarize yourself with Solidity and the Ethereum blockchain. You can suggest some code changes that provide better efficiency with the same outputs.

## Code of Conduct
